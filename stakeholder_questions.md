Ms. Smith, you mentioned you want the system to be simpleâ€”can you tell us what that looks like for you? What would make it easy to use?

How often does the table setup change? Do we need a super flexible way to rearrange them?

Should sellers be able to pick their own tables online, or would you rather assign them yourself?

How far in advance should people be able to schedule a bake sale?

Is there a limit on the number of sellers per event?

Besides cash and checks, do you want online payment options like PayPal, Venmo, or credit cards?

When a seller pays in cash, what details do we need to record? Date? Receipt number? Something else?
